# Hotel System

A WPF/PRISM/DryIoc based hotel reservation system which uses EF code first for data persistence. First attempt at using a DDD styled architecture. WIP but my main personal project of interest right now.

## Usage

Run the 'Update-Database' command from the nuget package manager console to seed the database before running the application.

## Modules

* Guests: Create, Updates, and Remove guests from the database
* Room: View the current status of all rooms
* Reservations: Able to go through the process of adding a guest (or using an existing one) and booking a reservation for one or more rooms
* Navigation: Simple navigation toolbar
